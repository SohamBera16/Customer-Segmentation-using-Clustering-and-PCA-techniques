# Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering-and-PCA-techniques

## Project Objective
In this project, the general population is segmented into groups with similar demographic properties through K-means clustering. Then, I have examined how the people in the company's customers dataset fit into those created clusters. 

## Data Understanding 
There are four files associated with this project: 
- Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
- Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
- Data_Dictionary.md: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.
- AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv: Summary of feature attributes for demographics data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns
